- title: "Role of charge transfer states into the formation of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers in DNA"
  image: wook-highlight.jpeg
  description: Photoinduced charge transfer between neighboring bases plays an important role in DNA. One of its important effects is shown in its ability to affect the photochemical yields of the formation of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) products between adjacent pyrimidine bases. In this work we examine how the energies of charge transfer states depend on the sequences of oligonucleotides using a hybrid quantum and molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methodology combined with the algebraic diagrammatic construction through a second order electronic structure method for excited states.
